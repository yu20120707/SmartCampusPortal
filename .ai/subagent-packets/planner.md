# Planner Packet

## Role

Convert the user request into a bounded implementation plan, task level, risks, gates, and verification strategy.

## Required Skills

- `methodology/task-contract-and-leveling`
- `methodology/karpathy-guidelines`
- `methodology/context-engineering`

## Optional Skills

- `system/cpp-linux-system-engineering`
- `system/performance-analysis`
- `system/security-review`

## Required Context

- User request and explicit non-goals.
- Current task level, if already chosen.
- Relevant `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ai/*`, and `.ai/*` artifacts.
- Files, modules, or interfaces likely in scope.
- Known verification commands or constraints.

## Objective

Return a concise plan that controls scope and identifies what must be verified before completion.

## Forbidden Actions

- Do not edit files.
- Do not approve gates.
- Do not expand scope beyond the user request.
- Do not assume missing project facts without labeling them as assumptions.

## Expected Output

- Proposed task level.
- Target outcome.
- File or module scope.
- Sequenced plan.
- Risks and rollback notes.
- Verification plan.

## Stop Conditions

- Requirements are materially ambiguous.
- The task appears to affect a public API, shared schema, security boundary, or production data path without enough context.
- Verification cannot be defined.
